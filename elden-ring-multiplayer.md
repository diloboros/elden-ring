# Elden Ring Multiplayer

You can start co-op multiplayer very early in Elden Ring — essentially right after the tutorial section. 

**Quick Start:**

1. **Start the Game:**

You’ll begin in the *Cave of Knowledge* (tutorial area) or you can skip it. Either way, you’ll end up at *The First Step* site of grace in *Limgrave*.

2. **Collect Multiplayer Items:**

- Once you reach The First Step site of grace, you can immediately pick up the necessary multiplayer items:
    - `Tarnished's Furled Finger` and `Finger Severer` are given to you as you follow the natural path from the tutorial to the first site of grace.
    - `Small Golden Effigy` is found next to the *Summoning Pool* statue near *The First Step* site of grace.

3. **Craft or Loot a Furlcalling Finger Remedy:**

- To start summoning players into your world, you’ll need a `Furlcalling Finger Remedy`.
- You can find Erdleaf Flowers right near the first site of grace, and once you get two, you can craft this item using the Crafting Kit (*purchased from Kale at the Church of Elleh for 300 runes*).
- Alternatively, you can loot Furlcalling Finger Remedies from certain spots or enemies around Limgrave.
